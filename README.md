# Module 5 Challenge: Third-Party APIs - Task Board

This Homework assignment was completed for Unit Five of the U of M Bootcamp, to practice javascript third-party APIs, building out a dashboard to create, view, and sort drag-and-drop task tiles. The complete code allows a user to input tasks with due dates, which are color coded white if not due yet, red if overdue, or yellow if due today.

The date is assigned with a DayJS datepicker to track; if a task is moved to the done column it will turn white. Tiles can also be deleted with their own delete buttons or viewed later, thanks to localStorage.
